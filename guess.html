            A local JavaScript hooligan has taken Dylan's favorite goose Gauss. Dylan saw the hooligan running away 
            from the family pond with a sack trailing feathers behind them. Dylan chased the hooligan 
            into a local canyon that has 20 separate trails leading to different caves. Which trail do you 
            think the hooligan followed? Pick a number to try and help Dylan recover their beloved Gauss. It is currently
            3 in the afternoon so Dylan only has time to check 3 different caves before the local dinnertime. Help
            them save Gauss before the goose has been degaussed.
