            A local JavaScript hooligan has taken Dylan's favorite goose Gauss. Dylan saw the goosenapper running away 
            from the family pond with a sack trailing feathers behind them. Dylan chased the hooligan 
            towards a local canyon system that has countless trails leading to different caves. You saw this person 
            run into a particular section but didn't think much of it at the time, so you don't know which trail they 
            took. Dylan stops to ask you if you saw which why the goosenapper went. You explain that you didn't see 
            exactly but could help them find the general direction. Which trail do you think the hooligan followed?
            <br>
            Pick a number to try and help Dylan recover their beloved Gauss. It is currently 3 in the afternoon
            so Dylan only has time to check 3 different caves before the local dinnertime. Help them save Gauss
            before the goose has been degaussed!
