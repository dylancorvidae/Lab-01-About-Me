    <h2>Dylan Corvidae</h2>
    <h3>My Flock</h3>

            <p>
                Hi, I'm Dylan Corvidae. To the left above is my child Kaon. To the right above is my partner 
                Bentley. Above center is my partner Elizabeth. I'm polyamorous* and have two long-term partners, Elizabeth 
                and Bentley. Elizabeth and I have been together for 12 years. Bentley and I have been together for 2
                years, Bentley is also my acrobatic partner. Kaon is the newest addition to my flock and my first child.
                They were born in October of 2018. We are raising Kaon gender neutral until they decide if they want to
                participate in the whole gender concept for themselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
                * Polyamory means many loves. Being polyamorous to me is about learning how to be a better person, personal improvement through 
                experiences with different loved ones that can teach each other new skills, ways of communicating, 
                and pushing past the maladaptive social conditioning that we are programmed with by society from birth. 
            </p>

        <h4>Duo Sadboi Bio:</h4>
        <img class="resize imgRight" src="assets/wolftrap.jpg" alt="Bentley and I in birds nest neck hang"/> 
            <p>
            Dylan Corvidae and Bentley Moses (Duo Sadboi), are queer circus performers 
            whose gender-defying duo acts showcase the power of trust, vulnerability, and interpersonal connection. 
            Duo Sadboi, established in 2017, currently specializes in dance trapeze -- through their work together, 
            Dylan and Bentley invite the audience to appreciate not only the spectacle they are seeing, but to imagine 
            themselves in the place of each character portrayed. In addition to their Duo Sadboi projects, Dylan and 
            Bentley's skills encompass a variety of circus arts as diverse as their multifaceted identities.
            Independently, Dylan trains in hand balancing, tumbling, yoga, various forms of dance, and is a 
            multi-instrumentalist/vocalist; Bentley collaborates on duo projects on lyra, trapeze, and chair dance 
            and is an aerial coach at Night Flight Aerial. Together, Dylan and Bentley are members of Sir Cupcake's 
            Queer Circus (led by Jack Stocklynn).

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p><img class="resize" src="assets/sandman.jpg" alt="Me playing 12 string acoustic guitar with Bentley performing on lyra"/>
        I play a lot of different instruments. I started out playing trumpet in elementary school.  
        then in high school I picked up a guitar and never looked back. In college I started composing electronic music 
        and had to start learning piano. I can play bass, but I play bass like a guitarist. I love to 
        experiment with sound, hence I own many effects pedals. I play guitar with a cello bow, 
        ebow, slide, trem picking, tapping, drumsticks, whatever I can think of I try. Life and art 
        are about creation, experimentation, and pushing boundaries. I love epic romantic music that builds 
        atmospheres and evokes feelings through sound without use of words.
    </p>
    <p>
        Genres of music I enjoy: Post-Metal, Death, Doom and Black Metal, Post-Hardcore, Hardcore, 
        Cascadian Black and Doom Metal, Blackgaze, Dream Thrash, Punk, Post-punk, Swedish Skreamo, 
        Celtic/Irish folk, Fast Dirty Bluegrass, film and tv scoring.

    <h3>Quiz Time!</h3>
    <p>Dylan was sucked into the computer through the use of black

        them to their family?</p>
