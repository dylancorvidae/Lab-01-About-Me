    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p><img class="resize" src="assets/sandman.jpg" class="left" alt="Me playing 12 string acoustic guitar with Bentley performing on lyra"/>I play a lot of different instruments. I started out playing trumpet in elementary school.  
        then in high school I picked up a guitar and never looked back. In college I started composing electronic music 
        and had to start learning piano. I can play bass, but I play bass like a guitarist. I love to 
        experiment with sound, hence I own many effects pedals. I play guitar with a cello bow, 
        ebow, slide, trem picking, tapping, drumsticks, whatever I can think of I try. Life and art 
        are about creation, experimentation, and pushing boundaries.
    </p>

    <h2>Quiz Time!</h2>
    <p>Dylan was sucked into the computer through the use of black

        them to their family?</p>
