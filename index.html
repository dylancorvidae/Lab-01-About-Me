            <p>
                Hi, I'm Dylan Corvidae. To the left above is my child Kaon. Above center is my partner Elizabeth.
                To the right above is my partner Bentley.  I'm polyamorous* and have two long-term partners, Elizabeth 
                and Bentley. Elizabeth and I have been together for 12 years. Bentley and I have been together for 2
                years, Bentley is also my acrobatic partner. Kaon is the newest addition to my flock and my first child.
                They were born in October of 2018. We are raising Kaon gender neutral until they decide if they want to
                participate in the whole gender concept for themselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
                * Polyamory means many loves. Being polyamorous to me is about learning how to be a better person, personal improvement through 
                experiences with different loved ones that can teach each other new skills, ways of communicating, 
                and pushing past the maladaptive social conditioning that we are programmed with by society from birth.

        <h4>Duo Sadboi Bio:</h4>
                <p>
                Dylan Corvidae and Bentley Moses (Duo Sadboi), are queer circus performers 
                whose gender-defying duo acts showcase the power of trust, vulnerability, and interpersonal connection. 
                Duo Sadboi, established in 2017, currently specializes in dance trapeze -- through their work together, 
                Dylan and Bentley invite the audience to appreciate not only the spectacle they are seeing, but to imagine 
                themselves in the place of each character portrayed. In addition to their Duo Sadboi projects, Dylan and 
                Bentley's skills encompass a variety of circus arts as diverse as their multifaceted identities.
                Independently, Dylan trains in hand balancing, tumbling, yoga, various forms of dance, and is a 
                multi-instrumentalist/vocalist; Bentley collaborates on duo projects on lyra, trapeze, and chair dance 
                and is an aerial coach at Night Flight Aerial. Together, Dylan and Bentley are members of Sir Cupcake's 
                Queer Circus (led by Jack Stocklynn).

    <h3>Music</h3>

        </p>
        <p>
            Music has always been a huge part of my identity. I was exposed to live music at a very early age in the form of 
            barn dances and Irish Ceilis. My own musical pursuits started in elementary school with the trumpet.  
            In high school I picked up a guitar and never looked back. I started composing electronic music in college
            and started learning piano then. I can play bass, but I play bass like a guitarist. I love to 
            experiment with sound, hence I own many effects pedals. I play guitar with a cello bow, 
            ebow, slide, trem picking, tapping, drumsticks, whatever I can think of I try. Life and art 
            are about creation, experimentation, and pushing boundaries. I love epic romantic music that builds 
            atmospheres and evokes feelings through sound without use of words.
        </p>
        <p>
            Genres of music I enjoy: Post-Metal, Death, Doom and Black Metal, Post-Hardcore, Hardcore, 
            Cascadian Black and Doom Metal, Blackgaze, Dream Thrash, Punk, Post-punk, Swedish Skreamo, 
            Celtic/Irish folk, Fast Dirty Bluegrass, film and tv scoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Music is very important to me and has shaped me into who I am today. More specifically the 
            hardcore punk and metal scene. A lot of the ideals that I hold dear have come from what that 
            scene exposed me to and it will always be my home. Some of the things I learned in the heavy music 
            community were the ideas of making my own family of people who I'm not related to but can depend on 
            and love (intentional family), my love of socialism and progressive causes, respect for the self and 
            body, striving to be a better person in spite of the world we live in and the horrible things people 
            do to each other and themselves, and having passion for life and love.
